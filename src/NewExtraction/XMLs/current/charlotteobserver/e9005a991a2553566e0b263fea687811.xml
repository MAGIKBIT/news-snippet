<field name="desc">Order Reprint of this Story March 09  2018 04 45 PM Charlotte Ballet on Friday afternoon cancelled the opening  scheduled for later that evening  of “The Most Incredible Thing.” Saturday’s matinee was also cancelled  but plans called for the rest of the performances to go as scheduled  Saturday evening through March 18. A performance was added  as well  on March 14. Ticket holders may exchange for any other performance in the run  here . An email from the Ballet said that mechanical failure caused the delay. The Charlotte run is the American premiere of the fairytale/pop-music ballet  set to music by the Pet Shop Boys and based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale – and choreographed by Javier de Frutos  who’s also currently an artist-in-residence at the McColl Center.
