<field name="desc">California alleges hospital system unfairly inflated costs The Associated Press April 01  2018 06 28 PM SACRAMENTO  Calif. California s attorney general has sued Sutter Health  one of the state s largest hospital systems  alleging anticompetitive business practices that unfairly drove up costs for patients. The Los Angeles Times reports the lawsuit filed Friday claims Sutter charged prices for services that far exceed what the company would have been able to charge in a competitive market. Spokeswoman Karen Garner says Sutter Health officials had not seen the complaint and therefore declined to comment. Attorney General Xavier Becerra alleges Sutter set excessively high prices for out-of-network healthcare and restricted insurance companies from providing low-cost options. Never miss a local story.
