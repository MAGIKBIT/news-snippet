<field name="desc">Dale Earnhardt Jr. after NASCAR retirement  ‘Everything ... is so much more enjoyable’ “To have the support from the folks who saw how I was having to do it growing up  without family money  without anything given to me   Hemric told NASCAR.com..  Having to go work for it  that’s what’s made me the person I am. That’s what I go to sleep at night proud of … how I’ve gotten here and the support group I’ve had along the way.” The car will be sponsored by Smokey Mountain Herbal Snuff  which backed Hemric in four Xfinity races last season  including the playoff race at ISM Raceway near Phoenix where Hemric drove into the Championship 4. — Daniel Hemric (@DanielHemric) March 21  2018 Joe Marusak  704-358-5067; @jmarusak. </field>
