<field name="desc">Benfica s mascot eagle returns after flying away before game The Associated Press April 01  2018 07 53 PM LISBON  Portugal Benfica fans can breathe a sigh of relief. The team s mascot eagle is back. A day after one of the team s eagles unexpectedly flew away during a pre-match ceremony  the club said the bird had returned unharmed on Sunday.  Guess who s back...   the club said in a social media post accompanied by a photo of the eagles.  You can stop worrying  they are all here.  The eagles are released before home matches and fly around the Stadium of Light. They are supposed to return to a trainer standing near midfield  but the bird used before the team s 2-0 win over Vitoria Guimaraes on Saturday flew out of the stadium and kept going.
