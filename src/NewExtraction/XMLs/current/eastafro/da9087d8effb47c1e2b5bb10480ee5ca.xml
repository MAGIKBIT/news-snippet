<field name="desc">    It is unlike any other city in the developing world – brilliantly planned with hardly any slums. As the cold war with Ethiopia finally ends  Asmara can at last look to the future   Nakfa House  a mammoth building by Asmara’s standards  is a remnant of the last era of real optimism in  Eritrea . Built in 1995  four years after the country broke away from neighbouring Ethiopia – the jubilant culmination of a 30-year struggle for liberation – Nakfa was intended to symbolise a country heady with ambition  and  in Asmara  a capital city racing to to be the Singapore of Africa.   Asmara is special not only because of the buildings. It’s also about the urban planning Dawit Abraha  Asmara Heritage Project     It was also a mistake. At eight stories high Nakfa blocks the view southwards from the historic city centre along Sematat Avenue. Even more offensively  it looms over the Fiat Tagliero service station  an aeronautic icon of Italian-era futurism built in 1938  and perhaps the city’s most beguiling building. Nakfa  just across the road  seems to be “trying to block the Fiat from flying”  complains Dawit Abraha  assistant project coordinator of the Asmara Heritage Project. This ungainly high-rise – one of several built in the period – swiftly became a lesson in the dangers of misguided development  galvanising a nascent movement to preserve the city’s architectural heritage  which led to Asmara being listed as a Unesco world heritage site in July last year.     Asmara is unlike any other city. Three years after Nakfa was unveiled  Eritrea entered a bloody border war with Ethiopia  which killed tens of thousands and brought the country’s development to a standstill for two decades. Eritrea became a military state and Asmara’s mini-boom came to an abrupt halt as the country entered an era of isolationism and the city’s youth were conscripted to the front (many have yet to return). Thousands of young people still flee the country each year  though in July and August many wealthy Eritreans from overseas visit to see family and enjoy Asmara’s tree-lined avenues  art-deco cinemas and picturesque public squares.   The Fiat Tagliero building  an aeronautic icon of Italian-era futurism built in 1938.

Years of economic slowdown reveal themselves in worn-out facades  shuttered restaurants and half-empty corner shops. A town planning committee established in 1998 predicted that by 2015 the population of greater Asmara would be about 600 000  but current estimates suggest the number of permanent residents may be only half this. “It’s like a ghost city ” says Matsula T Kifle  a local music producer and veteran of the liberation war.     The Opera House bar. Ninety per cent of the city’s historic buildings remain intact. Photograph  Alamy But now Asmara is facing the future once again. On 8 July the cold war with Ethiopia finally ended  as Ethiopia’s new prime minister  Abiy Ahmed  and Eritrea’s longstanding autocrat  Isaias Afwerki  embraced and made peace. This has unleashed a rush of renewed optimism in Eritrea and raised hopes of an economic revival.     UN sanctions imposed in 2009 might be lifted this year  which could lead to more investment from abroad. Indefinite conscription  which started in 2002  is now expected to be limited. Strict economic controls – such as a total ban on private construction firms – might be loosened in the absence of justification for a fully fledged war economy. “It’s like a second independence ” says Thomas Tedros  a resident of the city who has been a non-military conscript for 15 years.     Asmara’s housing stock is inadequate  homes for private rental can cost around $250 a month  while average salaries are between $30 and $80.

The housing stock is inadequate  homes for private rental can cost around $250 a month in a place where average salaries  according to locals  are between $30 and $80. The city should be popular with tourists but its potential has so far been squandered. “Asmara is a jewel of architectural and historical buildings and we do not want this to be wasted ” says Tedros  who trained as an engineer before being conscripted. “We want the city to be renovated.”   The city now has strict heritage laws and the first revisions to ​​its building code since 1938     Asmara is uniquely blessed in some respects  90% of its historic buildings remain intact  having escaped natural disasters and the worst ravages of war. Unlike most cities in  Africa   it has an original masterplan  which was rigorously adhered to after being drawn up by the Italian colonists in 1938. “Asmara is special not only because of the buildings ” explains Abraha. “It’s also about the urban planning.”     By the late 1930s it was the continent’s most modern city  boasting more traffic lights than Rome  as well as a multistorey car park. Today  unlike Addis Ababa  capital of neighbouring Ethiopia  Asmara has a complete and reasonably functional drainage system. Unlike almost any other city in the developing world  it has very few slums. According to Medhanie Teklemariam  the city’s director of urban planning  80% of all buildings are fully documented  even in the slum-like district of  Abba Shawl   the former “native quarter” under the Italian administration.     Bowling club. By the late 1930s  Asmara was the continent’s most modern city.

These were not just confined to unsightly buildings compromising the integrity of the city’s original design. The city was also allowed to sprawl  abetted by a policy of selling off land on the edge of city to the diaspora as a way of generating hard currency. According to Gabriel Tzeggai  an Eritrean urban planner  the city doubled its physical size in the 10 years after independence  but without substantially addressing the basic needs of its residents.     Asmara … ‘Years of economic slowdown reveal themselves in worn-out facades  shuttered restaurants and half-empty corner shops.’ Photograph  Tom Gardner for the Guardian   Edward Denison  associate professor at the Bartlett School of Architecture  University College London  and co-author of Asmara  Africa’s Secret Modernist City  worries that similar mistakes could be made again unless there is strong regulatory oversight. Eritrea still has a dearth of urban planners and architects  on top of a perennial shortage of municipal resources. “If there’s a free rein on development because of people’s expectations  it would be a disaster ” he says.     Can Asmara become a modern city without losing its charm? Efforts are under way to make this happen. The city now has strict heritage laws and the first revisions to its building code since 1938. A new masterplan has been designed  which will allow for development in the city centre – making use of the many empty plots and old factory spaces – but under tough guidelines. High-rises will be permitted in districts outside the historic centre. A ringroad is being built so that heavy trucks are kept out. Some hope that one day there will be a light-rail system  as in Addis Ababa.   “It’s a living city ” says Abraha. “We can’t keep it as a museum.”   </field>
