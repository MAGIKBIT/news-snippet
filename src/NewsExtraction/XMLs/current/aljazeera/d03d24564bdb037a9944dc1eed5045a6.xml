<field name="desc">News | Conflict Shock  fear in Tehran after Israel bombs residential  military areas The largest attacks on Tehran‚Äôs suburbs since the 1980s have stoked worries about what might come next.

Recommended Stories Israel may have just pushed Iran across the nuclear line end of list Across Tehran  residents on Friday were grappling with the shock of the first air strikes on heavily populated residential areas across the city since the eight-year Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. The building close to Roya‚Äôs house ‚Äì she requested that only her first name be used ‚Äì was among many residential units targeted by Israeli warplanes during at least five rounds of air strikes that lasted several hours. At least six nuclear scientists and physicists  including a former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran  were assassinated in the attacks. Several of the country‚Äôs top military commanders were killed as well  including the armed forces chief-of-staff Mohammad Bagheri  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander-in-chief Hossein Salami  and IRGC aerospace force chief Ali Akbar Hajizadeh.

Some family members of the officials and scientists were killed alongside them. Khamenei and other top officials have promised to take revenge and blamed Israel and the United States for significantly escalating tensions and risking all-out war. Iran‚Äôs diplomats and nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami also blasted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its much-criticised chief Rafael Grossi  for refusing to forcefully condemn repeated Israeli and US threats of air strikes  or the overnight attacks on Friday. They said the global nuclear watchdog  which passed its strongest censure resolution against Iran in nearly two decades on Thursday  has become a ‚Äútool‚Äù for pressure by Israel and its Western allies. Grossi on Friday said the IAEA was opposed to any attacks on nuclear facilities. Iran‚Äôs main nuclear facilities at Isfahan‚Äôs Natanz were also extensively bombed by Israeli warplanes  with deputy nuclear chief Behrouz Kamalvandi telling state television that the aim was to penetrate the uranium enrichment sites buried deep underground.

The Israeli army also attacked a number of military sites and civilian infrastructure like power plants  in several provinces across the country. Advertisement Almost immediately after the strikes  people formed long queues at nearly all petrol stations across Iran  fearing shortages. Iranian officials said there was no disruption to fuel supplies and the country‚Äôs oil facilities were not damaged. The Information and Communications Technology Ministry announced ‚Äútemporary internet restrictions‚Äù were imposed in the aftermath of the devastating attacks. The Ministry of Culture said all art events and music concerts were cancelled until further notice as a result of the ‚Äúcriminal and terrorist‚Äù strikes. Some Tehran residents even left the city temporarily since Israel has signalled it wants to launch even more so-called ‚Äúpreemptive‚Äù attacks on Iranian soil in a self-proclaimed bid to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù itself. With residential areas heavily bombed and some buildings catching fire  authorities said a number of civilians  including children  were among those brutally killed. ‚ÄúShe was no military personnel  nuclear figure  or an official. She was just a girl who loved cycling and nature. She was my friend  her name was Najmeh ‚Äù tweeted journalist Fatemeh Kalantari  with a photo of her friend who was killed by Israel. State-backed demonstrations sprang up in Tehran and across the country to condemn the deadly strikes. The attacks came on the eve of Eid al-Ghadir  a significant religious event for Shia Muslims  during which Iranian authorities organise large-scale celebrations in Tehran and other major cities. Authorities said the events planned for Friday would be shortened  and some will be turned into protests against the latest killings by Israel  which has also massacred at least 55 000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and thousands of others across the region since October 7  2023. On Friday  US President Donald Trump acknowledged that he was aware the strikes were taking place  but said Washington provided no military backing. He urged Tehran to come back to the negotiating table and make concessions.

A residential building hit in the Marzdaran neighbourhood of western Tehran [Maziar Motamedi/Al Jazeera] Trump  who initially emphasised repeatedly that his only demand in the negotiations was for Iran not to have nuclear bombs  has hardened his position in recent weeks to demand zero uranium enrichment taking place on Iranian soil. Iran has emphatically denied this condition  arguing that enrichment at low levels for civilian use such as power generation is an inalienable national right for which Iran has made sacrifices ‚Äì including the past assassinations of its nuclear scientists. In response to the IAEA censure on Thursday  Iran said it will build its third nuclear enrichment site at a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù location  along with upgrading centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. Iran is now enriching uranium up to 60 percent  but maintains that it seeks no military application for its nuclear programme. The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that Trump unilaterally torpedoed in 2018 allowed Iran to enrich up to 3.67 percent under intense monitoring by the IAEA. Fordow was among the sites targeted by Israel in its attacks. The nuclear site is dug into the mountains to protect it from such strikes  with several explosions booming in the area and air defences activating on Friday. Iranian defence batteries appeared to be more successful in engaging incoming projectiles in Tehran on Friday evening  when Israeli warplanes also launched more attacks on Tabriz.
