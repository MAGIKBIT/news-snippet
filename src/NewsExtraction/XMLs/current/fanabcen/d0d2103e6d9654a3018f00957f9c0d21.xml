<field name="desc">Ethiopia’s economic reform agenda spurring promising domestic investment On Jun 10  2025 1 064 Addis Ababa  June 11  2025 (FMC) – Ethiopia’s investment landscape continues to show promising growth  supported by government reforms and a strengthening private sector that is gradually transforming the country’s economic outlook. Local investors are increasingly playing a vital role alongside foreign direct investors in driving industrial development and job creation  it has been learned. One inspiring example is Mr. Tofiq Kedir  CEO and Chairman of TK INVESTMENT GROUP  who has grown from humble beginnings to become a leading figure in Ethiopia’s industrial sector. Reflecting on his journey  Mr. Tofiq highlighted the critical role that Ethiopia’s Home Grown Economic Reform  macroeconomic reforms  and relevant government policies have played in supporting his business expansion. He specifically noted that the efforts of government entities  including the Ministry of Industry  have helped create a more enabling environment for local entrepreneurs like himself. “These reforms have helped me a lot all the way in flourishing my business ” he told Fana Media Corporation in a recent interview. These reforms and policies  aimed at improving the investment climate and promoting industrialization  have been pivotal not only in attracting foreign direct investment but also in empowering domestic investors to expand operations and create employment. Mr. Tofiq’s experience underscores the growing importance of the private sector in Ethiopia’s economic transformation. Born in Qellem Wolega’s Mugi city  Mr. Tofiq’s early life was marked by hardship. From working as a shoe shiner and vegetable seller  he cultivated an entrepreneurial spirit that later guided him through various endeavors. After serving seven years in the national defense forces  he returned to his home region to start coffee cultivation and related businesses. He later moved to the capital city of Benishangul Gumuz region  Asosa city  situated near the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam  where he expanded into edible oil and grain trading and established a mill and commercial building. According to him  his international work experience further broadened his business perspective. Today  Mr. Tofiq’s TK INVESTMENT GROUP operates seven factories within Bulbula Agro Industrial Park  with an investment exceeding 4.9 billion Birr  fully self-funded without external loans. The factories focus on processing soybeans into value-added products such as edible oil  cake  soya meat  medicine  and animal fodder  thereby enhancing Ethiopia’s agricultural output and reducing dependency on imports. Currently employing around 400 young workers  Mr. Tofiq emphasized that his industrial investments aim to contribute to Ethiopia’s development by creating job opportunities and fostering economic growth. He also praised the support from both federal and regional governments in completing infrastructure and facilitating the park’s operations. Looking ahead  Mr. Tofiq plans to expand the Bulbula Agro Industrial Park significantly  aiming to generate thousands of new jobs and further strengthen Ethiopia’s industrial base. His story serves as an example of how local entrepreneurship  supported by government reforms and policies  is playing a crucial role in the country’s economic transformation.
