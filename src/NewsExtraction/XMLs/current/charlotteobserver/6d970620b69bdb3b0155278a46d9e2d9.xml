<field name="desc">March 22  2018 01 27 PM Race  Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series STP 500. Distance  500 laps  or 263 miles. Where  Martinsville Speedway  a 0.526-mile  concrete and asphalt oval in Ridgeway  Virginia. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. TV  FS1. Radio  MRN. Last year’s winner  Brad Keselowski. Worth mentioning  Martinsville is the shortest track run in the Cup Series. Who’s Hot/Who’s Not HOT Martin Truex Jr.  His first win of 2018 also vaults him to the top of the leaderboard  where he should be a fixture the rest of the season. Kyle Busch  No wins yet for him  but those will come soon if his three Top 5 finishes are to be trusted. NOT Bubba Wallace  That runner-up finish at Daytona is really looking like an outlier now  as Wallace sits all the way back at 19th in the standings. Chase Elliott  This was supposed to be the year he made the leap  but ... 21st place overall? A 16th-place run in California? We might have to wait a little longer for his breakthrough.
